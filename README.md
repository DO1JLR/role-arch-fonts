Some fonts on arch


I only search fore some random font packages in the arch wiki and added them here.

Nothing fancy. Nothing special.

You clearly can do it better. 

But it will install some fonts with the result: You have more fonts installed on arch. YAY.


Please feel free to change and modify it.

I would be very happy if you create a pull request with your changes. Thanks
